# Data sharing

## Share/cite the data

- Your data/code/report should have Digital object identifier (DOI), a unique number that identifies the digital object
- Equivalent of an international standard book number (ISBN) for digital documents
- Allows citation of a dataset - citable DOI for your research output

## Data repositories

- **Dataverse**: A repository for research data that takes care of long-term preservation and good archival practices, while researchers can share, keep control of, and get recognition for their data
- **Zenodo**: A repository service that enables researchers, scientists, projects, and institutions to share data, publications, posters, images, software etc., with DOI
- **Dryad**: A repository that aims to make data archiving as simple and as rewarding as possible through a suite of services not necessarily provided by publishers or institutional websites

## Data repositories

- **Mendeley Data**: Share everything, with DOI. Private sharing
    - Example: Genotype data for a set of 163 worldwide populations
- **FigShare**: Primarily for image data, but users can upload anything
- **SlideShare**: Share presentations, viewable and downloadable

# Licensing


## Why license?

- Software licenses are about two things: **defining copyright**, and **protecting yourself** from being held liable if your software screws something up somewhere
- In the US, copyright is automatic – the right to copy your code is yours, no one else can copy it
- "Good writers borrow, great writers steal" - T.S. Eliot

## Copyright and Open Source

- Any creative work, including software code, is automatically eligible for intellectual property (and thus copyright) protection
    - Code that appears to be, or is expressly advertised as freely available has not waived such protection

- The open licences certified by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) grant at least the following rights
    - The source code is available, and may be used and redistributed without restrictions, including as part of aggregate distributions
    - Modifications or other derived works are allowed, and can be redistributed as well
    - The question of who receives these rights is not subject to discrimination, including not by fields of endeavor such as commercial versus academic

## Software Licensing

A few licenses are by far the most popular, including the following:

- GNU General Public License (GPL)
- MIT license
- BSD license (Berkeley Software Distribution)
- Apache License
- Do not use Creative Commons licenses for software (CC FAQ)

\tiny https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0

https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT

https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause

https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

https://creativecommons.org/, https://creativecommons.org/faq/#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software.3F

## Software Licensing

A listing of more than 50 existing open-source licenses can be found on the Open Source Initiative (OSI) page

**GPL-3**

- Use, modify, distribute
- Don’t hold the author liable
- Distributions must include the source code
- Software incorporating the work must also be under GPL-3 (MIT does not require that)

\tiny http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category

## Data Licensing

- In most jurisdictions most types of data (with possibly the exception of photos, medical images, etc) are considered facts of nature, and are hence not eligible for copyright protection
- Therefore, using a license is confusing and inappropriate
- Creative Commons licenses for data and text are recommended, either CC-0 (the "No Rights Reserved" license) or CC-BY (the "Attribution" license, which permits sharing and reuse but requires people to give appropriate credit to the creators).

\tiny https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/

## Publications Licensing

- **Creative works**: Manuals, reports, manuscripts and other creative works are eligible for intellectual property protection and are hence automatically protected by copyright, just as software source code

- Creative Commons has prepared a set of licenses using combinations of four basic restrictions:
    - **Attribution (CC-BY):** derived works must give the original author credit for their work
    - **No Derivatives (CC BY-ND):** people may copy the work, but must pass it along unchanged
    - **Share Alike (CC-BY-SA):** derivative works must license their work under the same terms as the original
    - **Noncommercial (CC BY-NC):** free use is allowed, but commercial use is not
    - **Mix-and-match (CC BY-NC-SA, CC BY-NC-ND)**

Only the Attribution (CC-BY) and Share-Alike (CC-BY-SA) licenses are considered “Open”

Use CC-BY for publications

## Human subjects research

- If you do human subjects research, you can not just put the data out
- Human subjects research must be reviewed by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). Clear protocol, informed consent, data protection plan
- Anonymized data may be exempt. But the IRB makes determination
- Not everything is research, e.g., data used only in a course

## HIPAA

- HIPAA = Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
- Special rules about medical data with any identifying information – focus on privacy and security
- Definition of “potentially identifying information” is very broad (zip code, dates of a survey)
- Special security measures = paperwork

## How to add a license

When a repository with source code, a manuscript or other creative works becomes public, it should include a file `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.txt` in the base directory of the repository that clearly states under which license the content is being made available

You may also want to include a file called `CITATION` or `CITATION.txt` that describes how to reference your work

## Example of CITATION

BibTex format

```
@online{wilson-software-carpentry-2013,
  author      = {Greg Wilson},
  title       = {Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned},
  version     = {1},
  date        = {2013-07-20},
  eprinttype  = {arxiv},
  eprint      = {1307.5448}
}
```

Rendered as: `Greg Wilson: "Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned". arXiv:1307.5448, July 2013.`

## Summary

- If you don’t license your software, it can’t be modified or reused - pick a license, any license
- Use MIT or GPL for software
- Use CC0 for data
- Cite sources of software and data
- Be careful with human data – ask, if not sure
