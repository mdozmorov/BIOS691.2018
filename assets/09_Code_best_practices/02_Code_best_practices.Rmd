## Automating everything

- Little automation is better than no automation
- It's more work to do things properly, but it could save you a ton of aggravation down the road

What to automate?

- what you're trying to do
- what you're thinking about
- what you're seeing
- what you're concluding and why

## Good vs. bad programming

- “Any fool can write code that a computer can understand”
- “Good programmers write code that humans can understand”
    - Martin Fowler, 2008

Bad programmer explains him/herself with comments, good programmer explains him/herself with code 

## Good code = Clean code

Follow coding conventions

- **PEP-8** for Python, **PSR-2** for PHP, google "\<language_name\> coding conventions" for more
- **Google's R Style Guide**, **R style guide** by Hadley Wickham

Clean code is

- Understandable at first glance
- Neat and elegant
- Unambigious
- Not necesserily computationally efficient
- Self-explanatory
- Maintainable

## Bad code

- Full of “magic” – variables/values noone can understand
- Cluttered, or too loose
- Redundant
- Poorly commented
- Does not follow conventions
- Hardly maintainable

**Code represents you – don’t write a bad code**

## Good variable names

Variable names – nouns

- informative
- unambigious
- descriptive
- variables are in lower case, constants are in UPPER case

## Good variable names

- **Tab completion** - Almost all modern text editors provide tab completion, so that typing the first part of a variable name and then pressing the tab key inserts the completed name of the variable. Employing this means that meaningful, longer variable names are no harder to type than terse abbreviations.

- choose and follow conventions
    - **underscore_convention**
    - **camelCaseConvention**
    - **dot.convention**

## Good function names

- Function names – verbs
    - “verb first” rule, e.g., print_full_name
    - informative, unambigious, descriptive, etc., as for variables

## Good naming practices

- Short but meaningful
- Don’t use spaces, either in variable names or file names, use underscore "_" instead, e.g., "tcga_first_batch"
- Be careful about extra spaces within cells, "female" is not the same as " female" or "female\ "
- Avoid special characters, except for underscores and hyphens. Other symbols ($, @, %, #, &, *, (, ), !, /, etc.) often have special meaning in programming languages, and so they can be harder to handle

## Refactoring

Refactoring – making better code

- Make code understandable by other developers. Here we ask ourselves a question; If I would give the code to my grandma, would she understand it?

- Increase readability of the code = reduce cluttering of the code. Make code loose in tight places and tight in loose places

- **Globally search-and-replace bad variable/function names**



## Principles of good code development

- **DRY**
    - Don't Repeat Yourself
    - Do everything to avoid code repetition!

- **WET**
    - Write Everything (more than) Twice
    - The first time you write a code, you are writing it for the solution, second for comprehension, third for efficiency and last for your sake

- **KISS**
    - Keep It Small and Simple
    - Simplicity over complicity, shorter over longer

## Computational reproducibility in plain language

- **Write code that uses relative paths.**
    - Don't use hard-coded absolute paths (i.e. `/Users/stephen/Data/seq-data.csv` or `C:\Stephen\Documents\Data\Project1\data.txt`). 
    - Put the data in the project directory and reference it _relative_ to where the code is, e.g., `data/gapminder.csv`, etc.  
- **Always set your seed.** If you're doing anything that involves random/monte-carlo approaches, always use `set.seed()`.
- **Document everything and use code as documentation.**
    - Document why you do something, not mechanics. 
    - Document your methods and workflows.
    - Document the origin of all data in your project directory.
    - Document **when** and **how** you downloaded the data.
    - Record **data** version info.
    - Record **software** version info with `session_info()`.
    - Use dynamic documentation to make your life easier.

## Summary of good software development practices

1. Place a brief explanatory comment at the start of every program
2. Decompose programs into functions
3. Be ruthless about eliminating duplication
4. Always search for well-maintained software that do what you need
5. Test libraries before relying on them
6. Give functions and variables meaningful names
7. Make dependencies and requirements explicit
8. Do not comment and uncomment sections of code to control a program’s behavior
9. Provide a simple example or test dataset
10. Submit code to a reputable DOI-issuing repository

The core realization in these practices is that being readable, reusable, and testable are all side effects of writing modular code, i.e., of building programs out of short, single-purpose functions with clearly-defined inputs and outputs 

## Ensure long-time usability and stability

1. Host software and resources on archivally stable services
2. Provide easy-to-use installation interface
3. Take care of all the dependencies the tool needs
4. Provide an example dataset
5. Provide a ‘Quick Start’ guide
6. Choose an adequate name
7. Assume no root privileges
8. Create agnostic installation platform or distribute different versions for each platform
