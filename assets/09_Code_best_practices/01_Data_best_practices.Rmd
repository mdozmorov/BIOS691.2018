## Spreadsheets

- Store data in text files, delimiter-separated
- Spreadsheets may be used for data entry and storage
- Analysis and visualization should happen outside of spreadsheets

\tiny Broman, Karl W, and Kara H. Woo. “Data Organization in Spreadsheets.” Accessed March 29, 2018. https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.3183v1. - Excel spreadsheet tips and best practices

## General spreadsheet tips

- Use a consistent data layout in multiple files
    - Your primary data file should contain just the data and nothing else: no calculations, no graphs
- Enter one piece of information in one cell
    - Don't use formatting, e.g., coloring, to convey additional meaning to the cell value. Instead, add another column, e.g., "outlier" with a boolean `TRUE` or `FALSE` indicator variable
- Use a consistent format for all dates, YYYY-MM-DD strongly recommended
    - Use "Text" format, where possible, to avoid autoreformatting, e.g., "SEPT9" will become "9/9/2018" displayed as "9-Sep"
    - Use "\`forward tick" trick to force text format

## General spreadsheet tips (cont.)

- Fill in all cells. No empty cells
    - Use a consistent fixed code for any missing values, e.g. "NA". Don't use numerical values like 999
- Use consistent file names for similar datasets
    - Never include “final” in a file name
- Save and distribute the data in plain text files
    - Use comma-delimited (CSV) format

## Spreadsheet horror stories

 - A public archive of spreadsheet “horror stories”
 - In 13 audits of real-world spreadsheets, an average of 88% spreadsheets contained errors (Panko, Raymond R. "What we know about spreadsheet errors." Journal of Organizational and End User Computing (JOEUC) 10, no. 2 (1998): 15-21.)

## Project organization principles

- One project = one folder
    - Create readable names for subfolders/code. E.g. `00_raw_data`, `01_raw_data_QC` etc.
    - Choose file names carefully. Don't put spaces and special characters in file names!

- Be sure to get and keep any/all data and meta-data possible

- Get the data in the most-raw form possible. Keep the original files, names intact. (gzipped) CSV Text format is the most preferable

- Separate data from code. Use relative paths in code. Create multiple `README.md`

## Another project organization idea

```
project/
| data/
| | processing_scripts
| | raw/
| | proc/
| tools/
| | src/
| | bin/
| exps
| | pipeline_scripts
| | results/
| | analysis_scripts
| | figures/
```

## Project organization principles

- **Script everything** - All analysis steps, including data cleaning (removal of outliers, correcting numbers, typos, renaming columns etc.) should be scripted

- **Scalability and universality** - ask yourself a question, if the data are updated (e.g., additional subjects) or you find some artifact that needs fixing, can you just “press a button” to update? If you work on a similar project, can you reuse your existing scripts with minimal modifications?

- **Document everything** - Text format, human readable. Explicitly tie files together. Have a plan to organize, store and make your work understandable by others

## File naming principles

- Machine readable
- Human readable
- Plays well with default ordering

## File naming principles

- Machine readable
    - Regular expression and globbing friendly
        - Avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, case sensitivity
        - Easy to compute on
    - Deliberate use of delimiters, e.g. "-", "\_" (think `cut -d "_" -f1,3,5`, `grep Notes` commands)

```

## File naming principles

- Human readable
    - Name contains info on content
- Easy to figure out what something is, based on its name
```
01_preprocessing.R
02_quality-control.R
helper01_rename-files.sh
helper02_merge-duplicates.py
```

## File naming principles

- Plays well with default ordering
    - Put something numeric first
    - Use the ISO 8601 standard for dates (YYYY-MM-DD _or_ YYMMDD)
    - Left pad other numbers with zeros

Good

## Data management

- Save the raw data
- Ensure that raw data are backed up in more than one location
- Create the data you wish to see in the world
- Create analysis-friendly data
- Record all the steps used to process data
- Anticipate the need to use multiple tables, and use a unique identifier for every record
- Submit data to a reputable DOI - issuing repository so that others can access and cite it

## Data management

- Data are cheap, time is expensive
    - A terabyte hard drive costs about US\$50 retail, which means that 50 Gigabytes costs less than US\$5
    - How much of your time is needed to generate 50Gb of code?
