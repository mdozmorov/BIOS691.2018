## RStudio

**What is it?**

- **R** is the underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no fun
- **RStudio** is a graphical integrated development environment that makes using R much easier.
    * RStudio offers some GUI (graphical user interface) features for R
    * The same R program is running underneath the interface
* RStudio is open-source software (and therefore is free)
    * Available for download at: http://rstudio.com
    
## Panes in RStudio

- There are four panes, and their orientation is configurable under "Tools -- Global Options." Defaults are:
    - Editor in the top left
    - Console bottom left
    - Environment/history on the top right
    - Plots/help on the bottom right.

## Projects

- First, start a new project in a new folder somewhere easy to remember
    - Keep project code and data in the same place
- Creating a project creates an `Rproj` file that opens R running _in that folder_. This way, when you want to read in dataset _whatever.txt_, you just tell it the filename rather than a full path. This is critical for reproducibility

## RStudio 

Open RStudio and this is what you will see:

\includegraphics[height=190px]{img/RStudioConsole.png}
\end{center}

## RStudio 

Outlined in red is the R Console:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=190px]{img/RStudioConsole2.png}
\end{center}

## RStudio 

You can open a new script in the editing window:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=190px]{img/RStudioConsole3.png}
\end{center}

## RStudio 

Or you can open an existing script:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=190px]{img/RStudioConsole4.png}
\end{center}

## RStudio 

There can be multiple scripts open in the editing window:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=190px]{img/RStudioConsole5.png}
\end{center}

## RStudio 

History tab shows command run:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=190px]{img/RStudioConsole6.png}
\end{center}

## RStudio 

Environment tab keeps track of the things the user defines:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=190px]{img/RStudioConsole7.png}
\end{center}

## RStudio 

Plots appear in the plots tab (as expected):

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=190px]{img/RStudioConsole8.png}
\end{center}

## Getting help

- Is there a built-in function that does **x**? and if so,
- Where can i find it among the +2000 R Packages in CRAN?

- Use `?function_name` to get help on a function from a _loaded_ package
- Use `??function_name` to search for the function across all installed packages, even not loaded
- Use `apropos("part_of_function_name")` if you forgot the exact name, to get suggestions what the function name may be
- `library(sos)`, `findFn` function, e.g., findFn("cosine", maxPages=2, sortby="MaxScore")
- Search engine is your best friend on many things

## RStudio keyboard shortcuts

- `Command (Ctrl) + Enter` - Run current line/selection, go to the next line  
- `Alt + Enter` - Run current line/selection, stay on the current line
- `Ctrl + 1` - Move cursor to source  
- `Ctrl + 2` - Move cursor to console  
- `Ctrl + L` - Clear console
- `Ctrl + Alt + I` - Create new code chunk
- `Ctrl + Alt + c` - Run current code chunk
- All the usual - `Ctrl + Z, C, X, V, S, O`

## Turning off annoyances

- Tools, Global Options:
    - Uncheck “Restore .RData into workspace at startup”
    - Set to Never: “Save workspace to .RData on exit: Never”
    - Uncheck "Show output inline for all R Markdown documents"

## RStudio summary

**Why use it?**

- Project-centric work - scripts and data are organized in one folder (project), easily accessible 
- Single workspace with four (rearrangeable, zoomable) panels
- Work on multiple projects simultaneously in several instances of RStudio
- Work on multiple (types of) scripts (rearrangeable tabbed interface)
- See all variables in R environment, easily visualize them
- Easy access to help, plots, packages
- Simple integration with Git version control system
