\tiny http://rpubs.com/

- **RPubs.com** is a free service from RStudio that allows you to seamlessly publish the results of your R analyses online
- Make sure your RMarkdown metadata is set to render to HTML rather than PDF. Render the document. Now notice the little **Publish** button in the HTML viewer pane. Click this. Sign in when asked, and give your document a name (usually the same name as the title of your Rmd).

Here are a few examples of documents I've published:

- [Introduction to RNA sequencing and analysis](https://rpubs.com/mdozmorov/rna-seq)
- [Methylation data analysis](https://rpubs.com/mdozmorov/methylation)
- [Reproducible research in data science](https://rpubs.com/mdozmorov/rr101)

**Note how RPubs doesn't share your code!** RPubs is a great way to share your analysis but doesn't let you share the source code. This is a huge barrier to reproducibility. There are plenty of ways to do this. One way is to go to [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com) and upload your code as a text file, then link back to the gist in your republished RPubs document.
