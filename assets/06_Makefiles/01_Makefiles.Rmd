## GNU make

- You will almost certainly have to re-run an analysis more than once, possibly with new or changed data
- **GNU Make** is a tool which controls the workflow of generating target/result files from the dependencies (source files)
    - Target/result files may be text files, standalone programs, packages

**Capabilities of Make**

- Make is for more than just a tool for compiling software
- The path from raw data to final results
- Automates/documents a workflow
- Intelligently handles the dependencies among data files, code
- Accounts for the updates in data, code
- Re-runs only the necessary code, based on what has changed

## Makefile structure

Makefile contains recipes in the form of:
```
target: dependencies
	<code>
```

- `target` - the outcome
- `dependencies` - the necessary parts to build the outcome
- `code` - outlines the rules to build target using dependencies

- All code/commands must be **tab-indented**
- Dependencies, if more than one, must be **space-separated**

## Makefile example

Save in `Makefile` text file, no extension

\footnotesize

```
# An example of obtaining counts and types of the cytobands 
all:	cytoband_counts.txt cytoband_types.txt

# Download the raw data
cytoBand.txt.gz:
	wget http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/$@

# Obtain counts of the cytobands
cytoband_counts.txt:	cytoBand.txt.gz
	zcat < $< | cut -f1 | sort | uniq -c | awk '{OFS="\t"} {print $$2,$$1}' | sort -k2 -nr > $@

# Obtain types of the cytobands
cytoband_types.txt:	cytoBand.txt.gz
	zcat < $< | cut -f5 | sort | uniq -c | awk '{OFS="\t"} {print $$2,$$1}' | sort -k2 -nr > $@

clean:
	rm *.gz
```

## How to use make

- If you name your make file `Makefile`, then just go into the directory containing that file and type `make` - it'll run the first recipe
- If you name your make file `something.else`, then type  `make -f something.else`
- By default, `make` builds the first target listed in the `Makefile`. Generally, the first target generates all other targets
```
all: target1 target2 target3
```
- To build a specific target, type `make target`. For example, `make cytoband_counts.txt`


## Typical Makefile recipes

- `clean` – commands to clean up the working directory from temporary files
- `test` – runs a series of tests
- `install` – installs a software

Typical software installation steps using Makefiles

```
./configure
make
make install
```

## Makefile variables

- A variable is a name defined in a makefile to represent a string of text, called the variable’s value. Variables are used to simplify recipes
- Defining internal Makefile variable
```
DB = "/home/genomerunner/db_2.00_06.10.2014""
```
- Using a variable
```
${DB} or $(DB)
```

## Using shell variables in Make

- Shell variables, e.g. `$HOME`, need to be prefixed by `$`

- Within shell variable use: `awk '{print $0}'`
- Within Makefile variable use: `awk '{print $$0}'`
- Capturing output of shell commands into a variable:  `TXT_FILES = $$(shell find . –type f –name "*.txt")`

**TIP!**

- The content of a Makefile runs in its own shell environment. The default shell environment is `/bin/sh`. To set shell environment to bash, use  `SHELL=/bin/bash`
- Why bother? Variable `$SECONDS` exists in `bash`, but not in `sh`. Other syntax incompatibilities, e.g., `if-else-fi` syntax

## Automatic variables

Makefile contains recipes in the form of:
```
target: dependencies
	<code>
```

- `$<` - the name of the first dependency
- `$@` - the name of the target of the rule
- `$?` - the names of all the dependencies
- `$(<F)` - the file part of the first dependency

Example:

\footnotesize

```
COMPILER = g++					# Define compiler
COMPILER_FLAGS=-c –Wall	# Define flags

hello.o: hello.c hello.h	# Recipe
		  $(COMPILER) $(COMPILER_FLAGS) $< -o $@
```

## Patterns

- A pattern rule allows "wildcard" matching between the target and the dependencies. The `%` wildcard is similar to the `*` wildcard in bash

Existing files: `module0_induction.Rmd`, `module1_basics.Rmd`, `module2_managingR.Rmd`

Makefile recipe:
```
%.html: 	%.Rmd
		echo $(@)
		./compile_slides $(basename $(@))
```

Results: `module0_induction.html`, `module1_basics.html`, `module2_managingR.html`

## Visualize Makefiles

There are tools to look at Makefiles, like `makefile2dot`

```
python makefile2dot.py < Makefile | dot -Tpng > out.png && open out.png
```

## Debugging Makefiles

- Problem: Make is doing something strange
- Solution: Keep is simple. Use `make -n -d` (`-n`, or `--dry-run` doesn’t run anything and `-d` turns on debugging information)

## More automation

- `snakemake` - workflow management system similar to make but uses Python syntax
- `Sequana` - a set of Snakemake NGS pipelines 
- `Drake` - Data workflow tool, like a "Make for data"
- `CWL` (Common Workflow Language) - a specification for describing analysis workflows and tools
- `Nextflow` - Data-driven computational pipelines
