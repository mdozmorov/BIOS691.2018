The Pitch should say why is it interesting, timely and insightful and what pre-reporting you’ve done. You must include:
a) A proposed title or headline
b) A lead
c) A list of the story’s key elements
d) An explanation of why this story matters now
e) A description of the data and link to the data you are using

Once I approve the pitch, call an expert on that subject  who can evaluate the relevance and accuracy of  the concept/trends you found in the data.
Write a maximum 150-word piece (including a  quote from the expert)  and create a map.

Build your own HTML/CSS page with the following:
- A meaningful headline that captures the story, not that simply labels the map
- Byline
- Your 150-word max text
- An interactive map. Do not create a static graphic.
- Link to original data set
- Link to the final clean data you used to create the graphic
- A photograph that reflects the topic as an illustration, centered. above the headline, with a caption and credit
